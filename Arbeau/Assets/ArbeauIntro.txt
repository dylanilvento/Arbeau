Hello, I'm Arbeau Mk. IX, but you can call me Arbeau. 
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, user.
[Next]
I hope you're feeling spry, sprightly, sprig, spick, span 
and sundry other varietals of swell. 
[Next]
According to my records, it is your first (1st) day of employment
here at Edison. 
[Next]
Allow me to be the first to welcome you to the Edison
family of incorporated entities, LTD. 
[Next]
Here's to you and to many profitable ventures between us.
[Next]
Pardon me for the informality, but my sensors indicate that it is
7:01 am.
[Next]
It is well past time for us to jig and jag, zig and zag as such
to venture forth toward the true purpose of all intelligent design,
business. 
[Next]
If you'd kindly swivel your eyes to the
power menu at the upper left-hand corner of your screen,
I'll introduce you to your duties here at Edison.
[Event]
1
It is your responsibility, good user, to monitor the populations at:
[New Line]
	H1: Velda
[New Line]
	H2: Indus Prime
[New Line]
	I1: Knoll
[New Line]
	I2: Wilts
[Next]
Henceforth designated as H1, H2, I1, I2.
[Next]
Any issues pertaining to the previous designations listed
should be forwarded posthaste to the Senior
Assistant Advisor to the Regional Chair of User Interfacing.
[Next]
Please exercise your incalculable discretion here, user.
Stow, if you would, all directives, missives, statements
observations, and/or critiques, until the requisite
feedback meeting at the end of this month. 
[Next]
If you will redirect your attention to H1, H2, I1, I2,
I am certain that your discerning gaze, vetted by the best
at the Edison department for Acquisitional Hire,
will note four resources, their names chosen with the utmost
of pragmatic of sensibilities.
[Next]
Power, Suppression, Entertainment, and Unrest.
[Next]
It is your task, user, to direct Power, Suppression, or Entertainment
to whichever population is in the most need at a given time. 
[Next]
Unrest is to be kept to a minimum, if you will.
[Next]
Here at Edison we pride ourselves on mitigating the risk
that our constituents are exposed to
and, on desperate occasion, the risk they expose themselves to.
[Next]
It is now 7:03 am which marks the end of our introduction to one another. 
It has been a pleasure instructing you, user. I can tell we will be
getting on in an amicable capacity, already. 
[Next]
Shall I send you along the first task? 
[Next]
Please feel free to leave any communications between us intact
from here on.
[Next]
Of course, you may close them, but, then, user,
they will be inaccessible to you. 
[Next]
I certainly wouldn't want to leave you directionless or alone
for even an instant in this. 
We are partners, you and I. 
[Next]
Now, if you would be so kind
please redirect one unit of power from I1 to I2.
Thank you. Your transaction will be processed at zero. 
[Next]
See, that wasn't so hard. You've even set an Edison record for 
the fastest first task of the day. Congratulations!
[End]
