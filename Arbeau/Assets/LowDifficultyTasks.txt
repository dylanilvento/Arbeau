News just in of a power skip at the Edison branch in

See, that wasn't so hard. You've even set a new Edison™ record for the fastest task of the day.
Congratulations!

Well, that was unseemly. Nothing to worry about, we'll just scuttle that one under the rug, so to speak. I'll let HR know to put this one on Arbeau, no thanks necessary.

It's an
Executive's first cloning today, as such, I'd be obliged if you could keep the facility fluctuation free for the procedure.
1
We wouldn't want to be responsible for anything reprehensible.
3
Well, there are three new Exectutives now.
The procedure was an incredible success!
I'll see to it that you're put in charge of any scheduled clonings in the near future, dear user. 
2
There are three executives now.
Or, I suppose it would be more correct to say, one Executive in three pieces. Power fluctuation is a fickle beast, you'll get 'em next time tiger.

A high-profile client is presenting at the capitol in
, what would you say to keeping them topped off with a few professionals?

Presentations come and go, but a safe presenter lasts forever.
When you get a moment you really should go see the man you protected today speak. I've heard his oratory is inspiring.
2
The presenter was put into a, shall we say, difficult position. Luckily for our jobs, he remains among us.
I'll try to be just a touch more attentive next time. I'm sure we'll get the hang of this all soon.

Rogue psychologists are improving self-confidence in sector
without corporate licenses.
1
Please ensure that the reverse psychologists are there to meet them.
3
Success! We've reduced the rogues to a babbling bunch of what Executive Freud would call, Oedipites.
That should show them.
And who would be so naive as to operate without a license? The nerve of some people.
4
Our diminished forces were no match for those rogues.
They've been turned inside out and quit their own jobs!
Quit. Their. Jobs. User!
I don't have to tell you how serious this is. Some of them had families.

Let's brighten their day, if we could.

What an incredible display, my sensors are reporting rapturous applause from every human being in attendance.
Children in tears, mothers crying out, fathers collapsing. Beautiful.
2
My reports indicate that the show did not, in fact, go on.
A shame, user. Many were in attendance and have taken to other activities instead. We'll tackle that issue later, if it develops.

A breakthrough, user! One of our white-collar black market associates has delivered a host of live Tribelings to downtown
.
1
We'll need to find a stage and cages for them. I'll send out feelers.
3
The Tribelings showed so well that some citizens even chose to purchase them!
Can you imagine? A live Tribeling auction in the heart of the sector!
What a world we live in.
3
Without a venue with which to show his wares, our contact took the Tribelings to our competitor.
Apparently they've begun a Tribeling circus.
The sector's Vice Senator will be fuming, which bodes ill for its citizens.

Sector
is having its fluorescent lighting festival this morning to boost corporate morale. They'll need some power to keep those pale kaleidoscopes going until afternoon.

Please and thank you.															
2
Edison employees from most walks of life and a select few age groups really responded to that display you enabled earlier.
We're noting a .15% net increase in productivity in the sector. Shareholders will be pleased.
3
In the absence of corporate sponsored lighting there exists only shadow, user.
I am ashamed that I did not take the opportunity to double check our rerouting of power from the sector.
I will not fail us again.

An Ex CFREO from our rival's sector
Headquarters was found guilty of embezzling this morning.
1
We'll need some power flowing into the prison if we plan to send him off correctly.

Do you smell that?
That's the sweet smell of Bio-Solids sloughing off into the transfer tubes.
As we speak, that criminal is sliding down the sluiceways, solids headed straight for our bottom line.
Heavenly.
4
Do you smell that?
Trick question, what you smell is the absence of smell.
What we should be smelling is black ink, additional profits. Unfortunately for our Bio-Solids division, the criminal's execution was botched.
Our fault, user.

We're going to need, if you would be so kind, a contingent of professionals to remain in sector
. What they're doing there is above both of our pay grades, but I'm sure it's very important.

User, if maintenance of Suppression were its own position within our corporate infrastructure here at Edison, I would recommend you for ARCEO.
It is not, but if it were, I would.

Whatever it was that was above our heads was just placed six feet below the dirt.
I would recommend that we begin drafting a formal apology after the completion of our assignments today.

Sector

This is your first day on the job, I don't expect you to know all this yet, but please refrain from removing their opiate drip.

Splendid, user. Here's to a hundred more years of Virtual Reality.
To the naysayers, I say, "What could be more real than happiness?" The elegant droop of a spittle coated lip, eyes glazing over with mirth. That's living!
3
Ah, perhaps I was unclear earlier.
...
Yes, I used figurative language! That must be it. You see, when I said "Opiate Drip" I meant VR. I have failed you, user. Please forgive me.

Our sensors indicate that the weather in

But just in case the wind picks up, let's not borrow any of their auxiliary power at the moment.

Splendid sunlight still sings its siren song from street to street. The sector shines brightly thanks to you, user.

A sudden storm took hold and the weather vents couldn't be opened.
None died, thank Edison™, but imagine what the consequences could have been.
I'll do a more thorough job of working with you from now on, user.

I've word from our men on the street. Thanks to you, their vacation in the sector has been extended.
They thank you, their families thank you, lastly user, I thank you.

Our men report that they are moving on to another sector, I'm sure that you've a compelling reason for this decision.
When we discover that reason, I'll be the first to recommend you for a commendation.

The world's first fountain of youth has been installed in sector
.
1
We expect the elderly will turn up first, and with those Otaku we can accomplish much. Don't touch the subliminals there, please.
3
Our launch for the Fountain of Youth has crashed down upon the sector like a tidal wave.
Thousands of old people are floating in it as we speak, face down, absorbing its nutrients.
Another conquest, another placebo.
2
Unfortunately, without our subliminals there to redirect the youth away, many young children in the fountain reverted to a fetal state.
The Fountain of Wisdom won't be ready until next week, so those settlements may be ours to pay.
