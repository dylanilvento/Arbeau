A data center in 
requires our assistance, would you consider routing them a steadier supply of power? 
2
This could be quite important.
If all goes well, maybe even promotion worthy.

You've done old Arbeau proud, user. 
The data center is running reliably, and it's all thanks to you.

Reports are in that a century's worth of vintage automotive magazines were deleted in that outage. 
A small subset of the population will be furious. Though, it's not your fault user, the data center should have sent for help sooner.

Is there any way you could keep the DenialVeils at full power quietly? Thank you, user.

Ah, Arbeau Mk IV, your fried memory tethers smell so sweetly of failure. 
I owe you 1% on your next pay check for taking care of that little AI hiccup. 
4
That can't be good...
My reports indicate that Arbeau Mk IV is running amok in the sector's Project Beacon code.
I suppose there's no use crying over spilled millions of lines of code.
It's my fault for putting us in a position to fail.

Be vigilant, user. We're being called to ensure that an ARCFO makes it to his meeting in 
on time, so to speak.

Also, if a rival exective should not make it to his meeting, all the better.
2
I see that you bypassed the professionals and notified Experts. Excellent judgment call, user.
In such a short time you've become a master. The Executive himself has authorized me to say so. 
2
User, this is worrying. I've no response from HQ about our meeting, but a press conference has confirmed both the arrival and success of our rival's exectuive.
I shudder at the implications. Shareholders may even sell.

Word in that a distant cousin of yours has just been scalped and vivisected by Orphans in
. My condolences.

Let's make sure the buggers are caught and tried for their crimes. 
3
The professionals have seen to it that each Orphan receive the same treatment as your cousin did.
Some were even made to do it to one another.
Justice served, dear user.

I suppose he was just a distant cousin, but I thought you would relish the chance to condemn his captors.
It is a weakness of mine, dear user, I shouldn't presuppose.

We're in need of a real whizzbang, a whip-cracking whirligig of a diversion. Give the people what they deserve.

Bringing that 20th century cartoonist back from cryosleep was an absolute stroke of genius.
People across every sector will be talking about it for minutes.
I have never been prouder of a partner, user.

Word has it that a janitor was actually doing his job at the sector capitol today. He saw things, user.
Nearby professionals redirected him, but it doesn't seem that the public will accept our rival as a scapegoat... this time.

A breakthrough, user! One of our white-collar black market associates has delivered a host of live Tribelings to downtown
.
1
We'll need to find a stage and cages for them. I'll send out feelers.
3
The Tribelings showed so well that some citizens even chose to purchase them!
Can you imagine? A live Tribeling auction.
What a world we live in.
3
Without a venue with which to show his wares, our contact took the Tribelings to our competitor.
Apparently they've begun a Tribeling circus.
The sector Vice Senator will be fuming, which bodes ill for our compatriots downtown.

Our  
headquarters is running its Project Beacon test today.

Ideally, the beams cast from within will bathe distant cities in sun-bright illumination. Mark their power supply as Priority 1, please.

Aside from a few unintentional blindings, all went swimmingly with Project Beacon.
Well done, and please don't fret over those sightless individuals. Funds were allocated toward settling their grievances in advance.

User, we must be more careful.
A power fluctuation blew out every window in the building, resulting in a veritable blizzard of shrapnel. The damages will have to be docked from your wages.

Don't touch that power dial in

Just trust me, don't.																		
I can't explain to you why at this moment, user. But as partners, we must trust one another.

Ah, well done. You successfully avoided touching the button for the full minute.
That was part 4 of the 10 part Edison promotional test!
You exhibit inspiringly obedient tendencies, user.
You'll be climbing the ranks in no time.

That must have been a slip of the wrist, user. Nothing more, nothing less.
We'll chalk it up to the ergonomic inefficiencies of your work space.
I'll inform corporate momentarily.

We've word of a plot to assassinate him.
Vice Senators do not grow on trees, user, take care.

The Vice Senator has been assassinated,
by our plant, a former employee of a rival company.
You did it, user. And, thanks to your swift action, we found and rehired their plant! Will your wonders never cease?

The Vice Senator was assassinated by a former employee of Edison today.
Perhaps with one more Professional there, things would have been different.
A sad day. I wonder what HR will tell his mistresses.

Today we unveil "Edison ED", the most potent male enhancement product ever synthesized. 
We'll need all celebrities on deck for the launch, don't let them leave the sector.

Outside of my Greek mythological databases, I've never scanned anything quite like what just happened in the sector. 
All I can say is that in roughly two decades we'll have doubled our market for Edison ED. Remarkable!

Fertility values just increased by 0.02%, user.
We were expecting 0.2%.
At first I thought it was an error, but that's impossible. We made machine error obsolete decades ago.
I must apologize for our failure here, user.

Today's their day. Let's take this opportunity to wow them.

A representative called and asked for our resource department directly.
They've scheduled another day! Well done.
I've no doubt you'll be here seven to nine years from now to take care of their reservation again.

Experts have been installed in 
to protect the Edison Expert Replication Facilities.

If our competitors were to get their hands on those clones, well... keep those experts in place, if you would.
2
By the time you finish reading this message we'll have twice the experts we had yesterday, which is four times the number fielded by our closest rival. 
That's a cornucopia of experts, user. By any measure, a triumph. 
3
Word has it that our Experts were replaced with professionals, user. 
Professionals, as you should well know at your current paygrade, are less than half the men that Experts are. 
In short, we lost the cloning bays, a lachrymose day.

We've just hit the benchmark for a threefold increase in employment two decades out. That can all be attributed to your efforts here today. 
Look forward to a percentage commision contingent upon your employment in twenty years.

Human rights activists are being subdued as we speak, but we had to spend resources on hiring additional machine rights activists to yell them down in the media. 
I expect our paychecks will be cut accordingly. 
My apologies.
